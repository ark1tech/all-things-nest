## Description

The Library API allows you to manage a collection of authors and books. It includes features such as:

- Creating, updating, retrieving, and deleting authors.
- Creating, updating, retrieving, and deleting books.
- Managing relationships between authors and books.

## ERD

Here's the Entity-Relationship Diagram for the Library API:

```mermaid
erDiagram
    AUTHOR ||--o{ AUTHOR_BOOK : writes
    BOOK ||--o{ AUTHOR_BOOK : written_by
    AUTHOR {
        string id PK
        string name
        string contact
    }
    BOOK {
        string id PK
        string title
        int published_year
    }
    AUTHOR_BOOK {
        string author_id FK
        string book_id FK
    }
```

This ERD illustrates the relationships between the entities in our Library API:

1. **AUTHOR**: Represents the authors in our system.
   - `id`: Unique identifier for each author (Primary Key)
   - `name`: Name of the author
   - `contact`: Contact information for the author

2. **BOOK**: Represents the books in our system.
   - `id`: Unique identifier for each book (Primary Key)
   - `title`: Title of the book
   - `published_year`: Year the book was published

3. **AUTHOR_BOOK**: Represents the many-to-many relationship between authors and books.
   - `author_id`: Foreign Key referencing the AUTHOR table
   - `book_id`: Foreign Key referencing the BOOK table

This design allows for:
- An author to write multiple books
- A book to be written by multiple authors
- Efficient querying of the relationships between authors and books
